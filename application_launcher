To create a launcher, create the file  ~/.local/share/applications/eclipse.desktop with the following lines (Note that you have to change the icon and exec paths to your own):
[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=Eclipse
Comment=Eclipse IDE for Embedded C/C++ Developers
Icon=/home/javi/eclipse/eclipse-embedcpp-2022-03/icon.xpm
Exec=/home/javi/eclipse/eclipse-embedcpp-2022-03/eclipse
Terminal=false
Categories=IDE
StartupWMClass=Eclipse

Add execution permissions to the file
chmod +x ~/.local/share/applications/eclipse.desktop

Once this is done, you should be able to find Eclipse in your applications and execute it.
