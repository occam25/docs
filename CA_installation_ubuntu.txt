Create extra folder:
sudo mkdir /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/extra

Copy certificate to the folder and update system certificates:
cp my_cert.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/extra
sudo update-ca-certificates

In case of a .pem file on Ubuntu, it must first be converted to a .crt file:
openssl x509 -in foo.pem -inform PEM -out foo.crt

Or a .cer file can be converted to a .crt file:
openssl x509 -inform DER -in foo.cer -out foo.crt
